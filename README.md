Kream.co.kr Product Web Scraper and Data Exporter to Excel

## Description

This web scraper is specifically designed to extract product data from Kream.co.kr, a renowned online retail website. The scraper employs asynchronous programming techniques to efficiently crawl through product pages, download HTML content, and parse crucial information such as the English name, name, brand name, URL, and model number.

## How it Works

The web scraper utilizes a loop to continuously fetch product data until it encounters a specified number of consecutive bad requests. Upon a successful scrape, the parsed information is both displayed on the console and saved in a list of `Product` objects. The scraped data is then exported to an Excel file using the `SaveDataToExcel` function, allowing easy access for further analysis.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Simply run the application. The scraper will automatically fetch data from the Kream.co.kr website.
2. Monitor the console output to view the progress and the product information being scraped.
